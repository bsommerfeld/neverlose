# Neverlose - Training Plan Software For Table Tennis

## The Problem

In my club, training plans were a rare and precious resource. Our coach would painstakingly write them by hand and then
photocopy them for everyone. This whole process was a huge hurdle. If you missed the initial handout, you had to hunt
down someone else's copy to make your own. Often, the handwriting was hard to decipher, and the exercises were too
generic because creating individualized, handwritten plans for each player would have taken an eternity.

Things came to a head when I joined a competitive team. We were dedicated and wanted to improve, so our team captain
decided we should take charge of our own training. That's when I decided to build a solution.

## The Solution: A Dedicated Plan Editor

I started developing a simple tool to digitize our training plans. The core idea was to create clean, readable plans
that we could easily export as PDFs. This way, we could share them with each other and always have them on our phones.

But as I worked on it, I realized this problem was much bigger than just my team. I wanted to create something that
could help any player or coach facing the same frustrations. That’s how **Neverlose** was born. It's a desktop
application designed specifically for table tennis players and coaches to create, manage, and share training plans with
ease. It’s not a digital coach, but a powerful tool to make planning more efficient and professional. To make sure it
meets the real-world demands of the sport, I developed it in close collaboration with experienced coaches, building on
their valuable insights.
